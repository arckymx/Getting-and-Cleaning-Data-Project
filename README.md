## Tidy dataset (R script and new data set)

The tidy dataset was created using the R script called run_analysis.R which functions to (1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set; (2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Code Book

The CodeBook.md will explain the (1) variables and (2) transformation performed in the data.
